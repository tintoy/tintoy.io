Wow. Just... wow. It's been [more than a year](../stay-tuned) since my last post. I have no idea how the time got away from me.

In the end, this was what drove me to seek a new role at work. So I'm no longer running our platform team, but am instead now responsible for driving our [open-source projects](https://github.com/DimensionDataResearch/). I can honestly say that I've gone from dreading each day of work to loving my job :)

The best things about my new role:

* Multi-language
* Multi-platform
* Getting to engage with the broader community
* Focus is on invention / innovation; seeing what's _possible_

Starting next week, I'm going to make it my goal to produce at least one post a week (I certainly have a big enough backlog of content).

**Edit:** found 2 posts from the beginning of the year, so I guess it's only been 6 months. But considering how many stretches of "only 6 months" there have been, I stand by my original statement :)
