I've finally had enough time to start opening up our codebase at work.
<!--more-->
Most of our (Dimension Data) stuff can be found here:

* [Dimension Data R&D](https://github.com/DimensionDataCBUSydney/)
* [Dimension Data Cloud Services Platform](https://github.com/DDCloud)

Now that I'm over the hump, expect a lot more content to follow in short order :-)

PS. I'm particularly proud of our [WebAPI client toolkit](https://github.com/DimensionDataCBUSydney/Watt). If you're building a client-side .NET wrapper for a web API, it's [well-worth a look](https://github.com/DimensionDataCBUSydney/Watt/blob/development/v1.0/Watt.Tests/RequestBuilderContextTests.cs#L27).
