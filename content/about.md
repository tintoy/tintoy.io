I've been writing software for a long time; more than 30 years, by my estimation. And I'm pretty good at it.Â Ever since I was 7 years old, I've enjoyed making software; it's an interest that waxes and wanes as I find and discard other interests and hobbies, but it's one I keep coming back to.

But I've never really learnt much about computer science, itself. I was hired as a developer when I was only 18 months into my degree, and never looked back. But recently, I've decided to learn more about the maths and formal logic behind programming.

I imagine that most people do it the other way around; learn the theory, then learn the practice. Doing it this way should be an interesting trip.

These ramblings represent my personal opinion, and not those of my employer, [Dimension Data](http://www.dimensiondata.com/en-AU/Solutions/Cloud/).
